Software: These are the computer programs that make it possible to execute specific tasks within a computer. For example, operating systems, applications, web browsers, games or programs.

Inventory: Inventory is the manual verification that the physical and real quantities in stock of each product in our pharmacy coincide with the quantities of each product registered in the management computer program.

Firewall: is a computer network security system that restricts Internet traffic incoming, outgoing, or within a private network.

Functional requirements: describe the capabilities or functions that the system will be able to perform.

Non-functional requirements: restrictions or characteristics that define the system, such as performance, user interfaces, reliability, security, portability, standards, among others.
